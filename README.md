### 🔥 Why This Exists

This is my comeback library — born out of academic setbacks, mental burnout, and the dream to level up. Instead of consuming random tutorials, I built a **systemized vault** to:

- Focus on what matters.
- Learn with intent.
- Build proof-of-work.

If you’re someone who’s been rejected, overlooked, or doubting yourself — this repo is for you.
